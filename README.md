## **Problem Statement**
The objective of this project is to:
1. **Forecast Future Cash Flows**:
   - Project free cash flows using revenue projections, fixed assets schedules, and net working capital estimates.
2. **Compute Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)**:
   - Use WACC to discount future cash flows back to their present value.
3. **Determine Terminal Value**:
   - Estimate the company's worth beyond the forecast period.
4. **Calculate Enterprise Value**:
   - Discount the terminal value and forecasted free cash flows to determine the enterprise value and the company's overall valuation.
5. **Analyze Financial Performance**:
   - Answer critical questions about the company's financial health and trends over time.
